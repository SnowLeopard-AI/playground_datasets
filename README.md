# Playground Datasets

Welcome to [Snow Leopard](https://www.snowleopard.ai/)'s public playground's datasets!

This repository contains information on how to see **Snow Leopard in action** with public datasets.


## About Snow Leopard

Snow Leopard is an AI-powered data platform that helps you build business-critical AI Agents using your business data directly with real-time data retrieval from structured data sources (SQL databases, data warehouses, etc.) on-demand. No need for ETL and pre-defined data pipelines and workflows. 


**Here's how it works:**
1. **Natural Language Input**: Ask questions about your data in plain English
2. **Intelligent Routing**: Snow Leopard creates a retrieval plan in real-time for what data is needed to answer your question
3. **Live Data Retrieval**: Snow Leopard generates and executes the necessary queries on the data source(s)
4. **Response Summarization**: Provides clear, actionable insights from your data

**Why Snow Leopard?**
- Empower your AI Agents, AI assistants and other AI applications with your internal data in real-time
- Access business data locked in databases and API systems
- Get fresh, accurate data for critical business decisions without pre-defined pipelines
- No ETL required - data is fetched on-demand
